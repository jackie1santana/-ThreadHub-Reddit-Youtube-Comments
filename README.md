# react-ts-auth-webpack-eslint-express-# Reddit-Style Comment Thread Application

## Description
This application replicates a Reddit-style comment thread with parent-child relationships. The structure allows for comments and replies, where the parent ID of null identifies a root comment, and any ID that matches the parent's ID is recognized as a child comment. The data structure allows for complex nesting and recursion up to a maximum depth of 10 levels.

## Technologies
- **TypeScript**: Used for static typing to ensure code reliability.
- **React**: Utilized for building the UI components.
- **ESLint**: Integrated for code linting and maintaining code quality.
- **Webpack**: Responsible for bundling the application.

## Features
- **CRUD Operations**: Complete Create, Read, Update, Delete functionality for comments.
